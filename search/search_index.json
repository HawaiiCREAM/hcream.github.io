In other words, the speed of all traffic on a road is controlled by the speed of the public transportation along that road. It is a paradox because worsening the road for private driver to improve public transportation will create more motivation to use public transportation, improving private transportation as well. This motivates research improving bus transportation in high traffic areas, such as that of Honolulu, Hawai'i. Honolulu ranks 18th worst city in the United States for the annual global traffic scorecard for 2023 by INRIX.</p> <p>City bus networks are comprised of a set amount of bus stops and bus routes carrying passengers between the bus stops according to a fixed time schedule. This schedule is publicly available for almost every city bus system, with Honolulu as no exception. Therefore, Honolulu is a valid choice to perform a network analysis on.</p> <p>One may perform a network analysis on a bus network by setting bus stops as vertices and bus routes connecting bus stops as edges.

These files may then be imported into a graph visualization program, such as that of Gephi, a free open source software. From here, a proper graph file may be exported (.graphml), then imported into iGraph on R. From here, calculations are done strictly in R.</p> <p>This process creates a multi-edge directed network.

The communities highlight an important fact of bus travel: communities are easy to travel within, but difficult to travel between. Relevant to Oahu, rural areas of Oahu (districts one, two, three, and four) follow this rule, which the community detection has also determined.
