!!! note annotate "To be completed"
    - Need to finalize a way to collaborate on projects and documents.
    - Need policies on how we create ammendments.
    - Need a board of directors or some organizational leadership.
        * Idea: Direct democracy: every member votes on every decision.
        * Board should be elected according to some time period by members.
    - Need a fail-safe policy in case of a hostile takeover.

!!! note annotate "Ideas"
    - Any member can propose for an item slated for consideration in official meetings.
    - A member is defined as anyone who contributes to _HCREAM_ projects without a contract that denies membership.
    - Redundancies in financial accounts.
    - Voting is done in ranked-choice methodology.
    - Board Of Directors In HCREAM (_BODICREAM_) will meet triweekly.
    - Decisions that will affect more than fifty percent of the organization as decided by the board of directors will be held to a direct vote.
    - Any board of directors decision may be vetoed by the vote of the entire organization.
