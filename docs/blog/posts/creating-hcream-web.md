# Contributing to the Website

Bonjour my fellow HCREAMers. If you're reading this, then you have navigated to the blog section of the HCREAM website. I was always interested in creating a blog, so this will be my professional blog, along with yours as well.

I propose that we use _MkDocs_ to construct our website. If you look into the files, for example the one to create this page `hcream.github.io/docs/blog/posts/creating-hcream-web.md`, you can see that it is just a markdown file as is used in _GitHub_. There are a _few_ extensions added, such as the template _Material for MkDocs_ which gives a poopy internet connection good loading times, plus it looks slick. Most importantly for us mathematics, we may write some simple $\LaTeX$.

<figure markdown="span">
  ![malphite with caption](creating-hcream-web/malphit.jpg){ width="300" }
  <figcaption>You can also have an image that has a caption (most importantly, this is centered)</figcaption>
</figure>
